<b> Experiment|     <b> Verification of Superposition and Thevenin's Theorem

### About the Experiment 
  Thevinin's theorem is used to reduce complex circuit to single resistor and voltage circuit.Superposition theorem is used to solve the circuit when we have two or more than two sources.Here is the brief description of the procedure we will use to perform the required experiment:

We will restrict the number of resistors and sources but can vary the values under particular given range.
For Thevenin we will four resistors one voltage source and one current source.
For Superposition we will use four resistor out of which one will be load and two volatge source.
