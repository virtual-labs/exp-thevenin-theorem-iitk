1. Verification of Superposition Theorem<br><br>
The superposition theorem states that the response of a linear circuit to an arbitrary number of excitations is equal to the sum of the responses of each individual excitation. To verify the superposition theorem, the following steps should be taken:<br><br>
a. Simplify the circuit to its Thevenin equivalent.<br>
b. Remove all sources except one and measure the response of the circuit to that excitation.<br>
c. Repeat the process for each remaining source.<br>
d. Add the results of each measurement to obtain the total response of the circuit.<br>
e. Compare the result of the superposition theorem to the actual response of the circuit to all excitations.<br>
f. If the result of the superposition theorem is equal to the actual response of the circuit, then the superposition theorem is verified.<br><br>

2. Verification of Thevenin Theorem<br><br>
The Thevenin theorem states that any linear, bilateral circuit can be replaced by a single voltage source in series with an impedance, with the same response as the original circuit for any load. To verify the Thevenin theorem, the following steps should be taken:<br><br>
a. Simplify the circuit to its Thevenin equivalent, with a single voltage source in series with an impedance.<br>
b. Measure the voltage of the voltage source and the impedance of the series impedance.<br>
c. Connect a load across the terminals of the simplified circuit and measure the response of the circuit to that load.<br>
d. Compare the response of the simplified circuit to the actual response of the original circuit to the same load.<br>
e.  If the response of the simplified circuit is equal to the actual response of the original circuit, then the Thevenin theorem is verified.<br>
